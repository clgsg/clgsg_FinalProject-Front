# Megustalapachanga

This is my end-of-bootcamp final project. I designed the UX/UI thinking of the customer journey.

## Tools/stack
create-reat-app for the front, PostgreSQL for data, nodeJS, JWT for authentication.

## Goal of the app

The app aims to socialize and enable the practice of sports in a casual way by connecting players to play scratch games using public sports facilities (initially in Madrid).

### Home page (public)
A simple invitation to join, plus a 'taste' of upcoming pickup games (only sport and date are provided, user must be logged in to see complete information). 
This is the only public part of the site.

### User profile
Information about the user (username, email, gender, profile_pic, date of birth)

### Users games
Overview of user's games and suggested games, based on user's preferences.
From this area, users can create games or browse and join existing games.

### Preferences
User's preferences regarding sports
